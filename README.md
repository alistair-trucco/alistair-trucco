#### Hi, I’m Alistair

I've recently started programming for data science and analysis. 

I mainly use R but am dipping my toe into SQL and Python, with the goal to delve deeper into both, particularly for machine learning.

Reach out on alistairtrucco@gmail.com if you are interested in any of my projects and/or want to talk data!
